# Home hydroponics project

Funny project for home hydroponics pot. Currently used for tomatos growing. Some photos available 
[here](https://goo.gl/photos/3idt4aGHypY8L8e18).

Source code is for AVR ATMEGA328P MCU. It uses [ADK project](https://github.com/vagran/adk) for building. 
`ADK_ROOT` environment variable should point to ADK deployment and `scons` command executed.

There are also [electronics and construction files](https://github.com/vagran/hydroponics/releases)
attached for PCB production and 3D-printing.
